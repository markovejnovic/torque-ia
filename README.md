# Investigating the effects acting upon a rapidly rotating wheel free to rotate in all three dimensions

This is a paper conducted as my internal assessment. 
In the paper, I analyze motion of a rotating wheel on a gimbal. 
The paper tries to reveal the relationship between the angular velocity
of the flywheel in the x axis and the inclination of the wheel in the y
axis upon a controlled force rotating in the z axis.

The experiment was an absolute failure due to a broken potentiometer.
